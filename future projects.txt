Hi Team! 

Some of the discussion points from today:

+ Look at one DV at a time and see which ones are relevant for GWB
+ Force model variables into JDR framework 
+ Methods based pieces: cross validation (sample in half), use unique constructs (measurement invariance). 
+ Invariance in technostress based on demographic factors (for example, desired intensity).
+ Focusing in technostress and subscales 
+ Kulas is most interested in: fit these into JDR framework and measurement invariance of technostress scales across desired telecommuting intensity. 
+ We can keep unsurprising relationships as covariates (we could split it into GWB in one and then Job sat and turnover in another)
+ Attitudes toward telecommuting measure! 
+ Techno invasion and techno complexity past correlations in research since 2007. 

To Do: 

+ Renata: Ask lauren about using the data without identifiers 
+ Bixter: create Github account and email Renata once done to add 
+ All: Look at data before next meeting to discuss further 
+ Think about: what can we simplify from current model
